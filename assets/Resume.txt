RESEARCH & PROJECTS
“RNA_SEQ_Processing App” –  An all-in-one R Shiny web app for interactive RNA-seq analysis — no coding required. It includes differential expression, power analysis, Random Forest, PCA/UMAP, and pathway enrichment, a clean, tabbed UI with built-in visualizations and downloadable results. It is fully Docker, Singularity, and Apptainer compatible — perfect for HPC or local use.
Designed for bioinformatics teams and core facilities. Built for real-world datasets, reproducibility, and ease of use.
The GitHub repository for it can be  found at https://github.com/jcaperella29/RNA_SEQ_APP.
“JCAP GWAS Shiny App” – Interactive R Shiny platform for SNP QC, GWAS, gene mapping, pathway enrichment, and machine learning-based prediction. Accepts VCF/phenotype/covariate files, supports data visualization (PCA, UMAP, Q-Q, Manhattan plots), gene annotation, and power analysis. Fully containerized (Singularity/HPC-ready). It can be found at https://github.com/jcaperella29/GWAS_SHINY_APP.
“Bioinformatics Tools Hub”-
Front-End Web Development + Scientific Tool Integration | HTML, CSS, JS | Designed  and deployed a custom biotech-themed web portal to showcase RNA-Seq, ATAC-Seq, miRNA-Seq, GWAS  and other sequence analysis applications. Implemented a responsive, multi-tab interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for clear navigation of bioinformatics tools. Integrated animated DNA-inspired visuals and deployed using GitHub Pages for public access and open science collaboration. Enhanced accessibility for non-programming researchers by centralizing complex data workflows into a clean, web-based user interface.
